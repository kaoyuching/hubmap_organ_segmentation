# Kaggle_hubmap_organ_segmentation

Kaggle Competition: [HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-organ-segmentation)

This competition aims to segment functional tissue units(FTUs) across five human organs, including lung, spleen, kidney, largeintestine and prostate.

I got 100th place in the competition. The original EDA, augmentations, training, prediction codes are in the folder `original_code`.

I used `segformer` model and trained a binary model for each different organs.
